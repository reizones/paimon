        <p><strong>Genshin Impact Ningguang Albedo Team</strong>. I was just thinking about forming a shield-based team with my Ningguang c3 and Albedo c2. Each duplicate character you pull unlocks a Constellation passive. I threw bennett and xiangling on the team for pyro resonances and damage buffs. I was also going to have Sucrose c6 as support for added EM buffs to make shields extra strong and probably Beidou c2 for her burst shield and parry if needed.</p>
