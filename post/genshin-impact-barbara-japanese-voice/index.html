        <p><strong>Genshin Impact Barbara Japanese Voice</strong>. She makes amazing voice impressions of anime and Genshin Impact characters. Voiced by Zach Aguilar and 1 other. Although the voice actor is still listed as Laura Stahl theres a distinguishable voice change to Barbara. If Barbara was a new character and she had this voice I wouldnt have batted an eyelash but with the context of the old voice its kinda thrown me for a loop.</p>
