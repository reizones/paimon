<p>Genshin Impact banners adhere to a pretty regular schedule. Lastly if youve all been waiting for this character Xiaos character banner event and the Lantern Rites act will only be released from the 3rd of February 2021 to the 23rd of February 2020 in the Genshin Impact 13 Update right after Ganyus banner is over.

<p>Each update arrives with a new banner that lasts around three weeks and after it expires its. The Four-Stars accompanying him are Bennett Razor and Rosaria. Personally I think 2 weeks for each banner would be the right length provided that reruns were frequent and predictable so that you know with absolute certainty that if you cant get Eula this time then you will definitely be able to get her in 3 months or so. The Five-Star Anemo Sword user will be the second Banner on June 30 for the 16 update. Genshin Impact banners adhere to a pretty regular schedule.</p>
