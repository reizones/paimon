        <p><strong>Genshin Impact Barbara Or Qiqi</strong>. The four healers in Genshin Impact at the moment are as follows. Maybe Cryo is a better element than Hydro maybe her skills are much better than Barbaras and am I missing something but Im a bit confused why Qiqi is so popular. After all adding more characters means more competition for the highest tiers. Barbara makes your team immobile at cryo and electro areas although Barbara has the greatest amounts of healing overall.</p>
